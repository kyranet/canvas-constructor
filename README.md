A ES6 function for node-canvas with built-in functions and chained methods.

## Installation

Please check [node-canvas readme](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/blob/master/Readme.md#installation) for the installation. You **must** have Canvas installed and working before using this package.

---

How to use it:

```js
const { Canvas } = require('canvas-constructor');

new Canvas(300, 300)
    .setColor('#AEFD54')
    .addRect(5, 5, 290, 290)
    .setColor('#FFAE23')
    .setTextFont('28px Impact')
    .addText('Hello World!', 130, 150)
    .toBuffer();
```

- That will create a canvas with size of 300 pixels width, 300 pixels height.
- Set the colour to #AEFD54
- Draw a rectangle with the previous colour, covering all the pixels from (5, 5) to (290 + 5, 290 + 5)
- Set the colour to #FFAE23
- Set the font size to 28 pixels with font Impact.
- Write the text 'Hello World!' in the position (130, 150)
- Return a buffer.

Now, let's suppose we want to add images. I'd recommend [fs-nextra](https://github.com/bdistin/fs-nextra), by BDISTIN, it requires Node.js 8.5.0 to work (it promisifies the async fs methods with `Util.promisify()`), it's a dependency-free and lightweight package that provides support for **atomic operations**.

```js
const { Canvas } = require('canvas-constructor');
const fsn = require('fs-nextra');

async function createCanvas() {
    const image = await fsn.readFile('./images/kitten.png');

    return new Canvas(300, 400)
        .addImage(image, 0, 0, 300, 400)
        .setColor('#FFAE23')
        .setTextFont('28px Impact')
        .setTextAlign('center')
        .addText('Kitten!', 150, 370)
        .toBufferAsync();
}
```

- That will create a canvas with size of 300 pixels width, 400 pixels height.
- Draw an image, given a Buffer (the image from the images folder).
- Set the colour to #FFAE23
- Set the font size to 28 pixels with font Impact.
- Set the text alignment to center.
- Write the text 'Kitten!' in the position (150, 370)
- Return a buffer.

And now, you have created an image with a kitten in the background and some centered text in the bottom of it.

### Fixed

-   Browser support is now fully operational.
-   Fixed typing conflicts with `canvas`, since they added typings recently.
-   Fixed interface callback types, the `this` parameter is now typed.

### Removed

-   Removed options in `addImage`. Use `printCircularImage` or `printRoundedImage` instead.
-   Removed `addRoundImage`. Use `printCircularImage` instead, beware that (x, y) is the centre and not top-left.
-   Removed `registerFont` from `Canvas`, use the export from `canvas` instead.
-   Removed support for `canvas-prebuilt`. `canvas` already comes with them.

## 3.0.3

### Fixed

-   Resolved security vulnerability by upgrading to `handlebars@4.1.2`.

## 3.0.2

### Fixed

-   `Canvas#resetShadows()` not clearing shadows.

## 3.0.1

### Fixed

-   Publish not running the browser build, thus missing it sometimes or deploying old versions.

## 3.0.0

### Added

-   Added `Canvas#wrapText()`.

### Changed

-   Make `Canvas#addMultilineText()` not wrap lines.
-   Renamed `Canvas.getCanvas()` to `Canvas.internalCanvas`.
-   Renamed `Canvas.fromCanvas()` to `Canvas.from()`.
-   Changed the word wrap algorithm to respect newlines while also being slightly faster.
-   Changed callback return types in typings from `void` to `unknown` for strict rules to allow return.

## 2.1.1

### Fixed

-   Webpack builds in unpkg.

## 2.1.0

### Added

-   `Canvas#{toBlob,toBlobAsync}` for browser support.
-   `Canvas.fromCanvas()` for browser support (this is a must in browsers as you can't construct `HTMLCanvasElement`).
-   Examples for usage in web.

### Fixed

-   Webpack builds.
-   Guides being stale.

## 2.0.0

### Changed

-   The `restore` argument now default to `true` instead of `false`, the previous default kept functionality from pre-releases and 1.x but I couldn't change it under a minor version, only with a major one. But now I decided it's enough, and made it default to the intuitive, and very often most-wanted choice: `true`.

### Fixed

-   Fixed `addCircularImage()` adding the circular clip in the wrong center.
-   Fixed text not rendering in `canvas@2.x`.
-   Typings.

### Removed

-   `addBevelImage` has been removed. As per the deprecation added over 2 months ago, it has been renamed to `addBeveledImage`.

## 1.1.2

### Fixed

-   Fixed `addCircularImage()` adding the circular clip in the wrong center.

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

-   Fixed `addCircularImage()` not adding a circular clip before adding the image.

## 1.1.0

### Added

-   Added `toDataURL()` and `toDataURLAsync()`.
-   Added `addCircularImage()`, similar to `addCircle()`.
-   Added `setTextSize()`, similar to `setTextFont()` but changes the font size only (not the font itself).
-   Added all overloads for `addImage()`.
-   (Documentation) Added MDN link for `addImage()`.

### Changed

-   `createBeveledPath()` now accepts an object type `BeveledRadiusOptions`.
-   Renamed `addBevelImage()` to `addBeveledImage()` to prevent confusions (naming inconsistency). The old method is still available but it's deprecated and will be removed in the next major update.

## 1.0.0

### Added

-   Support for canvas 1.6.x and 2.x.
-   `addTextFont()` for canvas 1.6.x compatibility.

### Removed

-   `METHODS.md` in favor of the new docs.

## 0.4.0

### Added

-   `addMultilineText()` to print texts that are too long to be displayed.

## 0.3.1

### Added

-   Both `printLinearGradient()` and `printRadialGradient()` to have chainable methods.
-   Added a new parameter for both `createLinearGradient()` and `createRadialGradient()`, steps, which is typeof `GradientStep[]`.

### Changed

-   Both `createLinearGradient()` and `createRadialGradient()` are not longer chainable, they'll return `CanvasGradient` instead.

## 0.3.0

### Added

-   **Typings**. This package will also work in TypeScript.
-   `createBeveledPath()` same usage as `createBeveledClip()`, but does not create clips (so you can use shadows and fill to colorize it).
-   `createRoundPath()` same usage as `createRoundClip()`, but does not create clips (so you can use shadows and fill to colorize it).
-   `clip()` (how come this was not implemented?).

### Changed

-   **Canvas** has been moved from dependency to **peer dependency**.

## 0.2.0

### Changed

-   `addResponsiveText()` changed the parser to be passive, faster, and more accurate.

### Removed

-   Two private methods that were being used in `setTextFont()`.

## 0.1.7

### Added

-   `changeCanvasSize()` to change the canvas' width/height.
-   `changeCanvasWidth()` to change the canvas' width.
-   `changeCanvasHeigth()` to change the canvas' height.

### Removed

-   `registerTextFont()` as canvas-constructor relies on `canvas@1.6.6`, this method is useless.

## 0.1.6

### Added

-   `setStrokeWidth()` to change stroke/line's width.
-   `beginPath()` to start making paths.
-   `closePath()` to start closing paths.
-   `createLinearGradient()` to create linear gradients.
-   `createRadialGradient()` to create radial gradients.
-   `arc()` and `arcTo()`, to create arcs.
-   `quadraticCurveTo()` to create quadratic Bèzier curves.
-   `bezierCurveTo()` to create cubic Bèzier curves.
-   `lineTo()` to connect lines.
-   `moveTo()` to move the starting point of a path to any (x, y) coordinates.

### Changed

-   Added default `'#000000'` for the `setStroke()` method.
-   `addImage()` removed `this.save()` and `this.restore()` so users can use their own paths.

### Fixed

-   Examples for `measureText()`.

## 0.1.5

### Added

-   `save()` To save the current state onto a stack.
-   `rotate()` To add a rotation to the transformation matrix.
-   `scale()` To perform scaling transformations.
-   `traslate()` To perform translating transformations.
-   `fill()` To fill the current/given path.
-   `stroke()` To stroke the current/given path.
-   `addStrokeText()` To add stroked text.
-   `measureText()` To measure in pixels a text. Be **careful**, if you do not provide a callback (second argument), this method will return an Integer value instead of being chainable.
-   `setTextBaseline()` To set the text's baseline.
-   `setShadowOffsetX()` To set the shadow offset for the axis X.
-   `setShadowOffsetY()` To set the shadow offset for the axis Y.
-   `setGlobalAlpha()` To set the global alpha value for the next elements.
-   `clearCircle()` To clear the pixels with a circle shape.
-   `clearPixels()` To clear the pixels with a rectangle shape. (Usage is
    identical to `addRect()`).

### Changed

-   **Breaking** | `fillRect()` -> `addRect()` | To keep consistency.
-   `addText()` now accepts a third argument: `maxWidth`.
-   `addImage()` now saves and restores the context.

### Fixed

-   `addRoundImage()` now points to `addImage()` with the correct arguments.
-   `addBevelImage()` now points to `addImage()` with the correct arguments.

## 0.1.4

### Changed

-   Updated `README.md`.

## 0.1.3

### Fixed

-   Fix a weird bug with the `in` operator in `addImage()`

## 0.1.0

### Added

-   Added `addFont()` method for retro-compatibility with old versions of Canvas.
    (Thanks to [York](https://github.com/YorkAARGH) in
    [PR#1](https://github.com/kyranet/canvas-constructor/pull/1))

### Changed

-   Better `README.md`.

### Fixed

-   Bugs in the `options` argument for `addImage()`.
